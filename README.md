# WebFormsLab
You're going to use HTML forms and JavaScript to make a quiz!

You can pick the topic for your quiz. Ideas include music, cars, art history, recycling...

Include some multi-choice single answer (radio buttons) and multiple answer (checkboxes) as well as short answer (text input) and any other question types you want to try out. Maybe a drag and drop?

Use Javascript to check the answers, either one at a time or at the end once the user submits the whole thing. Make sure to provide useful feedback to the user!

Are you going to give an overall score? Are you going to allow more than one attempt or close the quiz after just one try? How about making a leaderboard or keeping track of current score and best score?

Note: make sure you use version control and push your code to GitHub because you'll find it comes in handy for the project assignment.
